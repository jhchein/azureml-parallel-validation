# Dispatch table: each row is one validation unit with three blob URIs.
# The parallel job splits this table by physical size (mini_batch_size)
# and passes each mini-batch as a pandas DataFrame to the entry script.
#
# Replace sample_dispatch.csv with your own CSV listing the actual
# azureml://datastores/<name>/paths/<path> URIs for your data.
